# MauiListApp
Tester app for new Maui

Currently testing a to do list with Maui framework for mobile and dekstop use.

<b><u>Current issues:</u></b>
<ul>
<li>SDK manager is not deploying latest api 32. Thus stopping any testing from mobile use during current VS preview stage.</li>
<li>Need to items re-visitable so that we can change if it has actually been completed or not or able then to remove it.</li>
<li>Improve visual look of project. Looking very tacky.</li>
<li>Found about thread safety singleton. Figure out more and make sure of it through the app?</li>
<li>Integrate sql/nosql for database.</li>
</ul>
